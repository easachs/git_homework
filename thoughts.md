1.  Two takeaways - success at Turing

    a. One significant key to success is consistently putting in work, following up and reviewing material. Many ideas are interconnected and going back to review old notes may help things to click for new material. Being able to sleep on new information multiple times will help consolidate and lock in new learning.

    b. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to put in 10-20 min researching it. There is a wealth of information available and some independent research can often compliment the curriculum by clarifying ideas and concepts in a new light.

2. Add at least one shoutout to someone who has helped you, supported you, or just been a positive presence in the last two weeks!
