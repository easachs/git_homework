1.  Two takeaways - success at Turing

    a. One significant key to success is consistently putting in work, following up and reviewing material. Many ideas are interconnected and going back to review old notes may help things to click for new material. Being able to sleep on new information multiple times will help consolidate and lock in new learning.

    b. If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to put in 10-20 min researching it. There is a wealth of information available and some independent research can often compliment the curriculum by clarifying ideas and concepts in a new light.

2. Two strategies to try

    a. Maintain consistency/maximize efficiency with note-taking. Setting up good habits early is critical for overall quality of learning.

    b. Form relationships with, reach out to peers and teachers in order to form a network, have other minds to bounce ideas off of, talk through new ideas, become inspired, put concepts into a new light for easier digestion. Learning difficult concepts with others will always beat learning alone. Facilitate a culture of learning.

3. Shout out - None of this (Turing, what I have learned in the first two Mod 0 sessions) would have been possible without the support from my girlfriend, my family, and my friends. While I have not formally started Mod 0 with the rest of my cohort, I would like to give them a pre-shout out for the support and guidance we will lend each other.
